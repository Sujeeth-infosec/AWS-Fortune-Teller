# AWS-Fortune-Teller

I am passionate about technology and Security and the role it plays in enabling businesses to achieve their goals. I am excited to continue to grow my career in the field of Cloud and Security Engineer and look forward to contributing to the success of future projects and teams.

I made this project as it my first project in github just for fun, it allows me demonstrate my technical skill in cloud computing. Very soon I am going to upload several projects that will help me strengthen my ability of doing the right things at the right time.
